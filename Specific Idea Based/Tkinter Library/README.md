# System Tools and Prank Scripts 🖥️🤣

This folder contains two Python scripts designed for different purposes—one for managing system shutdown/sleep with a countdown, and the other for a light-hearted GUI prank using Tkinter message boxes.

## Scripts in this Folder 📂

1. **Idiot Button Prank** 🤪🔘  
   A simple Python prank using Tkinter that displays a humorous message when the user clicks either of two buttons. Regardless of the choice, pop-up alerts appear calling the user an “idiot.” It’s a fun, harmless script meant to entertain or playfully trick friends through a basic interactive GUI.

2. **System Manager with Timer** ⏱️💻  
   This utility script lets users schedule a system shutdown or sleep after a set time, with a live countdown displayed via a Tkinter window. It prevents idle sleep using automated mouse movement and simulates system hotkeys for the final action. A cancel button allows safe interruption before execution.


## How to Use 🚀

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is located.
3. Install the dependencies using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the desired script from the terminal:

    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```

Each script provides its own GUI and user prompts.

## Requirements ⚙️

These scripts require the following libraries:

- `tkinter` (Standard GUI library for Python)
- `pyautogui` (Used for simulating mouse movement and system hotkeys)

Run the below script in command prompt to install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install tkinter pyautogui
    ```
