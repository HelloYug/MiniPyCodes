# 📝 **Menu Driven Programs**

This folder contains Python scripts that are designed with menu-driven interfaces. These programs allow users to interactively select options and perform various tasks. Below are the details for the programs present in this folder:

## 📑 **Programs in this Folder**

### 1. **BMI Calculator**
   - 🏋️‍♂️ A simple BMI calculator that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height.
   - 📏 The program allows users to input their weight (in KG) and height (in inches, cm, or meters) and calculates their BMI. It then provides a classification based on the BMI value (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
   - 🌐 It also gives the user the recommended weight for normal BMI based on their height.

### 2. **Python Turtle Pie Chart**
   - 🍰 A pie chart generator using the `turtle` library.
   - 🖍️ Users input the partitions of the chart (separated by commas), and the program generates a pie chart of the given data.
   - 🎨 It randomly selects colors for each partition and displays the corresponding percentage for each segment in the chart.

## ⚙️ **Dependencies**
This folder requires the `turtle` library for creating graphics and drawing the pie chart.

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install turtle
````

## How to Use 🚀

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is located.
3. Open a terminal and run the script you want to execute:

    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ````

Each script will prompt you for inputs and display the results in the terminal.
