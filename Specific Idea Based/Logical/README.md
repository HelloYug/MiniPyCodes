# Logical Python Scripts 🧠💻

This folder contains a set of Python programs that perform basic logical operations and algorithms. These scripts focus on solving specific mathematical and logical problems. 🧮

## Scripts in this Folder 📂

1. **Binary to Decimal Converter** 🔢➡️🔲  
   This program converts a binary number (entered by the user) into its decimal equivalent. It includes a breakdown of the conversion process.

2. **Finding Prime Numbers in Range** 🌱🔍  
   This script finds and displays all prime numbers within a user-defined range.

3. **Love Percentage Calculator** ❤️💌  
   A fun program that calculates a "love percentage" between two names. It uses a unique algorithm to compute this value based on character frequency.

4. **Permutation, Combination, and Factorial Finder** 🔄📊  
   This program allows the user to input commands like `5P2`, `5C2`, or `F5` to calculate permutations, combinations, and factorials.

5. **Pythagorean Triplets Finder** 🔺➗  
   This program generates the Pythagorean triplets from the given input `m` using the formula `(2m, m²-1, m²+1)`.

6. **Pythagorean Triplet from Side** 🔢📐  
   Given one side (smallest, middle, or hypotenuse) of a Pythagorean triplet, this program calculates the other sides and prints the triplet.

## How to Use 🚀

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is located.
3. Open a terminal and run the script you want to execute:

    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
