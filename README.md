The library supports operations such as string encryption using random insertions, number encryption based on square roots, and decryption using reverse logic. |
| **`Excel To MySQL`**          | This project is a Python script designed to extract data from an Excel sheet and insert it into a MySQL database. It is ideal for automating the process of transferring attendance or other tabular data from Excel into MySQL, simplifying the data management process.|
| **`HandPy Module`**           | A lightweight Python utility toolkit with reusable functions for formatting, math, encryption, validation, system tools, and more.|
| **`Whatsapp Greeting`**       | This project automates daily greetings and special occasion wishes (birthdays and anniversaries) to family and friend WhatsApp groups using Python and `pyautogui`.                                                                                                                           |
| **`Message Spamming`**        | A Python automation tool that helps you spam messages (and even media) on WhatsApp Web.|
| **`Specific Idea Based`** | A collection of Python projects that focus on specific themes, providing solutions to problems through interactive scripts and programs.|
| `├── Logical`             | A collection of Python scripts that perform basic logical operations and algorithms, such as converting binary to decimal, finding prime numbers, calculating love percentages, generating Pythagorean triplets, and solving permutation and combination problems.|
| `├── Menu Driven`         | This folder contains Python programs with menu-driven interfaces, allowing users to select options interactively. Programs like BMI calculators and pie chart generators (using the `turtle` library) are included.|
| `├── Random Library`      | A set of fun Python programs based on random events and user input. It includes tools like a coin toss simulator, a love test calculator, a dice roller, a Kundli match maker, and a personality trait generator.|
| `├── Tkinter Library`     | Python programs that use the `Tkinter` library for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It includes light-hearted pranks like the "Idiot Button" and system management tools like a timer for scheduled shutdowns or sleep.|
| `├── Turtle Library`      | A collection of Python scripts utilizing the `turtle` graphics library to create unique designs and shapes. Programs in this folder include drawing rangolis, a Mercedes logo, and the name "YUG" using turtle commands, along with more complex shapes and designs.                                                                                                              |
