## ⏱ How It Works
- The scheduler checks time every second.
- When time matches `next_morning` or `next_event`, it triggers greetings.
- It uses `pyautogui` to control the keyboard/mouse and send messages.

---

## 🧪 Usage
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Leave your system on. Messages will be sent at the configured time automatically.

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Do not move the mouse/keyboard while it's sending messages.
- Make sure your screen isn't locked.
- You can customize dates, messages, and groups in `data.py`
